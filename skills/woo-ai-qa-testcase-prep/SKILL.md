# Woo AI QA Testcase Prep

Use this skill when the user wants strong, detailed test cases before browser testing.

This skill is the preparation companion to:

- `skills/woo-ai-qa-browser/SKILL.md`

This skill is for **AI QA execution input**, not release publishing.

Use `skills/woo-dashboard-tc-publisher/SKILL.md` when the user wants:

- the compact Trello QA comment format
- CSV / Google Sheet rows
- positive-only sheet export
- sheet tab suggestions
- duplicate-review wording for sheet publishing

Use this skill first when the input is:

- a Trello card link
- a Trello card id
- a feature request
- a story description
- an AC draft
- an incomplete or weak test case request

## Goal

Given a Trello card or feature request, produce detailed, browser-testable test cases that are easy to verify in the Codex app using Chrome like a human tester.

The output should be good enough that the next session can take the test case and directly verify it using the Woo browser QA skill.

The output should stay detailed. Do not collapse cases into one-line summaries for Trello, and do not convert them into CSV rows.

## First reads

Before generating test cases:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read only the directly relevant project files:
   - `pipeline/card_processor.py`
   - `pipeline/trello_client.py`
   - `pipeline/smart_ac_verifier.py`
   - `pipeline_dashboard.py`
3. Treat these as the source of truth for:
   - AC and TC generation style
   - browser-verifiable scenario selection
   - Trello card data access
   - AI QA testability rules

Important execution boundary:

- Do not call the project `generate_test_cases`, `TrelloClient`, `ChatAnthropic`, Google Sheets, Slack, WooCommerce order APIs, or dashboard publish functions from this skill.
- Use the project files as reference material and generate the requested markdown directly in Codex/Claude.
- If live Trello content is not already available in the conversation, use `woo-trello-operator` to fetch it when the user gave a card reference. If Trello access is unavailable, ask the user to paste the card text.

Also use the automation repo as a verification-design reference:

- `$WOO_AUTOMATION_REPO_PATH`

Search that repo for similar scenarios before inventing new test structure.

## Required inputs

Best input:

- Trello card link or card id

Acceptable fallback input:

- raw feature text
- AC text
- user story text
- bug description

If the user gives a Trello card link or id, prefer the real card content over guesswork.

## What to use from Trello

When a Trello card is provided, collect:

- card title
- card description
- comments
- checklists
- attachments or linked implementation context if clearly relevant

Use comments as important context, not noise. Developer comments often contain hidden constraints, rollout notes, or missing acceptance details.

## What to use from project knowledge

Ground the test cases in:

- `AGENTS.md`
- current verifier behavior in `pipeline/smart_ac_verifier.py`
- AC/TC generation rules already implemented in `pipeline/card_processor.py`
- existing Woo/platform automation patterns
- known app architecture:
  - WooCommerce outside iframe when the card is WooCommerce or platform is not explicit
  - WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Magento, or PrestaShop admin/storefront when explicitly named by the card
  - Woo app/settings surface for the detected platform
  - the WooCommerce orders list and the order-screen label flow
  - Rate Summary, Label Summary, Request Log, and document evidence
  - settings, products, carriers, automation rules, order grid, and storefront differences

## What “good” test cases look like

The test cases must be:

- browser-verifiable
- detailed enough for human-like Chrome testing
- grounded in the real app flow
- separated by scenario, not mixed together
- clear about setup, action, and expected result
- clear about what evidence is needed

Prefer cases that can be verified by one or more of these evidence types:

1. visible UI state
2. order summary / grid status
3. request or response payload
4. rate log
5. downloaded document bundle content
6. printed PDF / commercial invoice text

## Output requirements

Write test cases in a detailed step style that makes the next verification easy.

For each test case, include:

- `TC ID`
- `Title`
- `Type`: Positive, Negative, or Edge
- `Priority`
- `Execution Flow`: the closest AI QA route, such as `orders`, `label`, `logs`, `settings`, `order-grid`, `product-admin`, `packaging`, `pickup`, `return-label`, `storefront`, or `none`
- `Preconditions`
- `Steps`
- `Expected Result`
- `Preferred Evidence`

Required AI-QA-compatible markdown shape:

```markdown
### TC-1: <short title>
**Type:** Positive | Negative | Edge
**Priority:** High | Medium | Low
**Execution Flow:** orders | label | logs | settings | order-grid | product-admin | packaging | pickup | return-label | storefront | none
**Preconditions:** <what must be true before testing>

**Steps:**
Given <initial state or precondition>
When <first user action>
And <additional action if needed>
Then <expected result>
And <additional expected result if needed>

**Expected Result:** <final expected behavior>
**Preferred Evidence:** UI | request log | response log | rate log | label file | bulk label PDF | orders list | settings persistence
```

Step rules:

- Every step line under `**Steps:**` must start with `Given`, `When`, `And`, `Then`, or `But`.
- Do not use numbered or bullet steps inside `**Steps:**`.
- Use `PH Woo app` or `PluginHive Woo` and include the detected platform.
- Navigation should use real dashboard/app paths like `WooCommerce > Orders > open order`, `order edit screen > Generate Packages > Calculate Rates > Confirm Shipment`, `WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping`, `Multi Carrier > <carrier> registration`, `Products > product > Shipping tab`, or the storefront `Cart > shipping calculator`. If a card names Shopify, BigCommerce, Magento, or PrestaShop, ask QA before running it here.

Preferred case flow:

1. Navigate to the correct app surface
2. Perform the exact action
3. Verify the expected result
4. Note the best evidence source if UI alone is not enough

## Generation rules

### 1. Produce browser-testable cases first

Favor cases that can really be verified in the detected platform admin/storefront and Woo app browser flow. If platform is not explicit, default to WooCommerce.

Do not generate test cases that require backend mocking, mobile layouts, or non-supported environments unless the user explicitly asks for them.

### 2. Pick the right flow

Decide whether each case belongs to:

- orders / label flow
- logs / document evidence flow
- settings flow
- order-grid flow
- product admin flow
- packaging flow
- pickup flow
- return-label flow
- storefront checkout flow

If a case cannot be verified from the browser alone, say so inside the case and prefer the nearest browser-verifiable variant.

### 3. Make evidence explicit

Do not stop at “label generated successfully” if the real proof should be:

- request payload
- rate log
- Shipment request/response `<pre>` blocks
- Print Label download (GIF / PNG / ZPL / PDF)
- Bulk label PDF text

### 4. Reuse known project patterns

Examples:

- shipment-purpose override:
  - global setting first
  - per-order override second
  - payload proof required
- carrier special services / insurance / signature:
  - Product shipping fields, carrier registration, or order-screen setup based on the card
- commercial invoice:
  - international only
  - PDF or document bundle evidence
- order grid:
  - search/filter/status-tab cases
- packaging:
  - base settings save
  - more settings for advanced options

### 5. Keep setup realistic

Use the same order-creation logic the project already understands:

- `create_new`
- `create_bulk`
- `existing_unfulfilled`
- `existing_fulfilled`
- `none`

Where useful, make the preconditions explicit in human terms:

- create a fresh international order
- use an existing labeled order
- enable Dry Ice in App Products first
- save the global settings before testing the override

## Preferred workflow

### If the user gives a Trello card link

1. Extract the card id from the link.
2. Read the card using project Trello logic.
3. Collect description, comments, and checklists.
4. Classify the feature area.
5. Search the codebase and automation for similar flows.
6. Generate detailed test cases.
7. If useful, point out which cases are best for immediate Chrome verification.

### If the user gives only story text

1. Infer likely flow family.
2. Search the automation repo for the closest existing scenario.
3. Generate browser-verifiable test cases in the same style.

## Case design guidance

Prefer:

- one clear behavior per test case
- explicit restore/cleanup note if the scenario changes global settings
- one evidence strategy per case unless multiple proofs are required

Avoid:

- combining settings change, order creation, label generation, and document validation into one giant case unless the feature truly requires that
- vague expected results like “works correctly”
- cases that are impossible to verify from the browser

### 6. Keep AI QA metadata internal to this output

`Execution Flow` is useful for Codex/AI QA handoff. It should not be treated as a Trello or Sheet column.

Use:

- `orders` for the WooCommerce orders list and opening an order's edit screen
- `label` for the Generate Packages → Calculate Rates → Confirm Shipment flow and label-result verification
- `logs` for Rate Summary, Label Summary, Request Log, response payload, document bundle, or PDF checks
- `settings` for settings persistence flows
- `order-grid` for filters/search/status tabs
- `product-admin` for Woo App Products or WooCommerce Products
- `packaging` for packaging settings and more-settings flows
- `pickup` for pickup request/details
- `return-label` for return label flows
- `storefront` for checkout/rate flows
- `none` only when no browser execution flow is relevant

## Handoff to browser verification

When finishing, make the test cases easy for the browser QA skill to consume.

If helpful, end with a short mapping like:

- `Best first case to verify`
- `Needs order-screen label flow`
- `Needs international order`
- `Needs request log proof`
- `Needs PDF / CI proof`

## If something new is discovered

If the card reveals a new flow, new field, or new verification pattern:

1. Generate the test case anyway.
2. Call out the new pattern briefly.
3. Recommend adding the learned pattern back into:
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `pipeline/smart_ac_verifier.py`
   - the browser QA skill if needed

## Final standard

The user should not need to explain the scenario twice.

If they give a Trello card and ask to test it, this skill should:

1. turn the card into strong detailed test cases
2. make the cases directly usable for Chrome verification
3. align the case structure with the existing Domain Expert project and automation knowledge
