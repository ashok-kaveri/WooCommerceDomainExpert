# Automation Flow

This reference mirrors `pipeline/automation_writer.py`, `pipeline/chrome_agent.py`, `pipeline/feature_detector.py`, and `pipeline/locator_knowledge.py`.

## Dashboard Flow

Current execution surface: WooCommerce Woo automation repo. For cards explicitly scoped to WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Magento, or PrestaShop, ask QA whether the shared Woo behavior should be covered through the current WooCommerce automation flow. Generate automation only after QA confirms and keep the reported platform visible in comments/evidence.

1. Find existing POM via registry/keyword matching.
2. Navigate to real page with stored auth/session and capture live elements.
3. Existing POM:
   - append new locators/methods
   - create separate new spec file
4. New page:
   - create new POM
   - update fixtures
   - create new spec
5. Review generated code.
6. Optional run/fix loop.
7. Commit/push only when requested.

## Existing POM Priority

Always search before creating:

- POM registry in `pipeline/automation_writer.py`
- automation repo page objects
- matching specs
- helper files
- fixture names

Use `rg` first.

## Common POM Areas

- Additional Services: dry ice, duties, tax, signature, saturday delivery, one rate, alcohol, dangerous goods, hold at location
- Packaging Settings: packaging, boxes, dimensions, weight based packing
- OrdersPage / order edit screen: single and bulk label generation, package building, rate calculation, shipment confirmation, label/log evidence
- Pickup Page: pickup scheduling/details
- Return Label Page: return labels/settings
- Carrier / Automation Pages: rate settings, carrier services, checkout rates, rate automation, label automation
- Products Page: product special services / WooCommerce product setup
- Order edit screen: packages built, rates calculated, shipment confirmed, Print Label available, tracking note written

## Automatable Case Filter

Prefer:

- Positive cases
- UI-safe Edge cases
- stable browser paths
- meaningful business assertions

Usually skip:

- backend-only failures
- API mocking
- server timeout/error injection
- unstable negative paths requiring external failures
- cases already fully covered by existing tests unless the AC requires an explicit regression spec

## Assertions

Prefer final-state assertions:

- label generated status
- success toast
- saved setting persisted after reopen
- printed/downloaded documents visible
- pickup confirmation/status
- order row status/filter result
- request/log row present when helper exists
- specific warning/error text

Avoid:

- page is visible only
- button exists only
- arbitrary sleeps
- invented helper calls

## Critical Spec Contracts

Use the repo's fixture import path. Do not import `test`/`expect` from `@playwright/test` in spec files when the repo uses setup fixtures.

Store declaration:

```ts
const store = process.env.STORE;
if (!store) {
  throw new Error('STORE environment variable is required');
}
```

Order creation must be a dedicated test block:

```ts
test('Create an order from API', async () => {
  orderUploader = new WooCommerceOrderUploader();
  const orderID = await orderUploader.uploadOrder();
  if (!orderID) {
    throw new Error('Failed to create WooCommerce order');
  }
  sharedOrderID = orderID;
  expect(orderID).toBeTruthy();
});
```
