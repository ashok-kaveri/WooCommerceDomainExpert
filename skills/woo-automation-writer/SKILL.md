description: Use when working inside the WooCommerceDomainExpert project after US/AC generation, dashboard TC generation, and AI QA browser verification are complete, and the user wants Playwright TypeScript automation written for an Woo card. Reuse dashboard automation_writer/chrome_agent conventions, inspect Chrome manually for DOM/locators, reuse existing automation locators/POM methods first, create new locators only when missing, and use saved AI QA locator traces by card id/name when available. The current automation repo uses the WooCommerce flow; explicit non-WooCommerce cards need QA confirmation first.

# Woo Automation Writer

Use this skill for the final automation stage in the Codex/Claude skill pipeline:

1. `woo-ac-writer-reviewer` generates reviewed US + AC.
2. `woo-dashboard-tc-publisher` generates dashboard TCs and publish formats.
3. `woo-ai-qa-browser` verifies selected TCs in the browser and captures evidence/locators.
4. `woo-automation-writer` creates or updates Playwright automation in the automation repo.
5. `woo-knowledge-maintainer` records durable automation/QA learning after the cycle is approved.

This skill mirrors the dashboard `Generate Automation Script` behavior while using Codex/Claude app tools.

Current execution surface: WooCommerce automation repo.

For cards explicitly scoped to WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Magento, or PrestaShop, ask QA whether the shared Woo behavior should be covered through the current WooCommerce automation flow. Generate automation only after QA confirms, and keep the reported platform visible in comments/evidence.

## First Reads

Before writing automation:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read:
   - `skills/woo-automation-writer/references/automation_flow.md`
   - `skills/woo-automation-writer/references/locator_trace_handoff.md`
3. Inspect only directly relevant project files:
   - `pipeline/automation_writer.py`
   - `pipeline/chrome_agent.py`
   - `pipeline/test_runner.py`
4. Inspect the automation repo under `WOO_AUTOMATION_REPO_PATH`.

Do not hardcode automation paths. Use `.env` / `config.WOO_AUTOMATION_REPO_PATH`.

## Required Inputs

Best input package:

- card name and card id or URL
- reviewed US + AC
- reviewed detailed TCs
- AI QA result/evidence
- saved locator trace from AI QA browser, if available
- any QA notes/test data

If AI QA has not run yet, ask to run `woo-ai-qa-browser` first or manually inspect Chrome before writing automation.

## Core Rules

- Confirm the card/test-case platform before writing code. If it is non-WooCommerce, ask QA whether to cover the shared behavior through the current WooCommerce automation flow before generating code.
- Open/use Chrome manually with Computer Use when locator or DOM certainty is needed.
- Reuse existing automation POMs, locators, and helper methods first.
- Do not duplicate an existing locator/method under a new name.
- If an existing locator is present but weak, prefer adding a small helper method around it instead of replacing old code.
- Create new locators only when no suitable existing locator/method exists.
- Append to existing POMs; do not rewrite/remove existing code.
- Always create a separate new spec file for the card.
- For a new page, create a new POM and update fixtures only when no existing POM fits.
- Follow the automation repo's actual style, imports, naming, fixtures, and folder structure.
- Keep automation focused on Positive and UI-safe Edge cases. Negative backend/API-mocking cases usually stay manual.

## Locator Trace Handoff

Before generating code, look for saved traces under:

```text
data/ai_qa_locator_traces/
```

Search by card id first, then slugified card name.

If no saved trace exists:

1. Use Computer Use to open the browser and manually execute the same flow.
2. Capture visible headings/buttons/labels/inputs/toggles and iframe context.
3. Save the trace using:
   `skills/woo-automation-writer/scripts/save_locator_trace.py`

The automation writer should use locator traces as supporting evidence, not blindly. Existing POM methods still win.

## Generation Workflow

1. Parse card + TC scope.
2. Filter automatable cases:
   - keep strongest Positive cases
   - keep UI-safe Edge case if useful
   - skip backend-mocking or unsafe Negative cases
3. Find existing POM by registry/keywords and repo search.
4. Search automation repo for matching specs/page objects:
   - `rg "<feature keyword>" $WOO_AUTOMATION_REPO_PATH`
   - inspect POMs/specs before creating anything
5. Open Chrome manually or use saved locator trace to confirm DOM and exact labels.
6. Decide:
   - existing POM append + new spec
   - new POM + fixture update + new spec
7. Edit files in automation repo following existing style.
8. Review generated code against project rules.
9. Run targeted Playwright test if user asks or if safe/available.
10. Report files changed, test result, and any manual follow-up.

## Code Style Must Match

Spec rules:

- import `test` and `expect` from the repo fixtures path, not directly from `@playwright/test`
- `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' })`
- order creation is a dedicated `test('Create an order from API', ...)` block when needed
- `const store = process.env.STORE; if (!store) throw ...`
- every test has at least one meaningful `expect`
- no `test.only`
- no `waitForTimeout` over 3000
- business assertions beat weak visibility checks

POM rules:

- POMs extend `BasePage`
- locators are readonly class properties
- page objects extend `BasePage` and locate on the page directly — there is no app frame
- WordPress admin locators use `this.page`
- new locator groups are appended and commented with the card name
- action methods are appended after existing methods
- prefer role/label/text locators grounded in actual DOM/trace

## Safety

- Do not write into the WooCommerceDomainExpert repo when the task is automation code; write into `WOO_AUTOMATION_REPO_PATH`.
- Do not change unrelated automation files.
- Do not rewrite fixtures unless adding a genuinely new POM.
- Do not push/commit unless the user asks.
- Do not run destructive git commands.

## Result Format

Return:

- automation decision: existing POM or new POM
- trace used: saved trace / manual Chrome inspection / none
- files changed
- cases automated and cases skipped
- test command run and result, if any
- follow-up needed
- knowledge-maintainer note if a locator, helper, or flow pattern should become durable project knowledge
