description: Use when working inside the WooCommerceDomainExpert project after cards are approved and the user wants professional release handoff documents like the dashboard Handoff Docs tab: Support Guide, Business Brief, or both, generated from approved US/AC, TCs, AI QA evidence, release/card metadata, toggles, and member ownership. If the user requests only one document, generate only that document and PDF.

# Woo Handoff Docs

Use this skill to generate professional handoff documents for approved PluginHive Woo release cards on WordPress/WooCommerce.

It mirrors the dashboard `Handoff Docs` tab:

- Combined release Support Guide
- Combined release Business Brief
- Optional single-card Support Guide / Business Brief for quick review
- Markdown + PDF output
- Trello/Slack-ready artifacts when requested

Default release delivery is one combined PDF per document type. If the user asks for only one document type, generate only that combined document. Use single-card documents only when the user explicitly asks for one card.

## First Reads

Before generating:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read:
   - `skills/woo-handoff-docs/references/handoff_doc_formats.md`
3. Inspect only directly relevant project files:
   - `pipeline/handoff_docs.py`
   - `pipeline_dashboard.py`

Use `woo-domain-core` research when local context is incomplete or customer-facing explanations need current Woo/PluginHive/WooCommerce facts.
Use `woo-trello-operator` to fetch card details/members or attach/comment PDFs when explicitly requested.
Use `woo-slack-operator` to send PDFs or messages to Slack when explicitly requested.

For release packages, always use full live Trello card context when available: description, comments, labels, attachments/checklist summaries, approved AC/TCs, and AI QA evidence. QA comments often contain late caveats and must not be skipped.

## Excluded Cards

Before anything else, drop cards that are not part of the release story set. Exclude any card carrying one of these labels:

- `SL: ON Hold`
- `SL: Carrier Platform`
- `Spill Over`
- `SL: Closed By Support`

Rules:

- Match labels case-insensitively and tolerate emoji, colour prefixes, and extra spacing around the name.
- Exclude the card from the index table as well as the body. A card left out of the body but listed in the index reads as a missing section.
- Include an excluded card only when the user names it or explicitly asks for it. Naming the card is the instruction — do not ask again.
- Never drop the card silently. Always report which cards were excluded and which label triggered it, so a short release is visibly deliberate.
- Excluded cards contribute no toggles to the `Toggle List Follow-Up` DM.

Before writing any release package, do a toggle audit for every card:

- Search the whole card for the toggle, not just the description: comments, checklists, attachments, approved AC, TCs, and QA evidence. The exact toggle key is often only in a QA or developer comment.
- Put the exact key in the index table `Toggle Name` column. List every key comma-separated when a card has more than one, and `None` when the card needs no toggle.
- Never guess or reconstruct a toggle key. If the card clearly needs one but no key is stated anywhere, write `Not stated` and flag it in the final response.

Before writing a release Support Guide, do a payload/log audit for every card:

- If the evidence asks support to inspect a carrier request, response, payload, request log, diagnostic log, invoice request, tracking payload, report source field, or automation-rule log, include the exact node/field name support must verify.
- Put the callout immediately after the relevant walkthrough step, using one of these exact bullet labels so the PDF renderer highlights it:
  - `Request node to verify: ...`
  - `Request nodes to verify: ...`
  - `Request/response nodes to verify: ...`
  - `Request/log fields to verify: ...`
- Do not add node callouts to UI-only, report-only, sync-only, or performance cards unless card evidence names an actual request/log field.
- If the exact field is unknown after checking card comments/checklists and code/context, say what log to inspect in troubleshooting and do not invent a node name.

Before writing Support Guide or Business Brief content, do a technical-card audit for every card:

- A technical card is one only a developer cares about: an API-only change, a library or version upgrade, a refactor, an internal clean-up, or infrastructure work with nothing support or the merchant can see or do.
- Move every technical card into a single `## Technical Cards` section placed after the last normal card section. Keep each entry to a few lines: what changed and why it matters.
- Keep technical cards in their normal position in the index table — only the body section moves.
- If a card has both a technical part and something support can see or demo, keep it as a normal card.

Before writing Support Guide or Business Brief content, do a platform audit for every card:

- Detect the customer/test platform from the title, labels, description, comments, linked ticket, PR notes, AC, TCs, and QA evidence.
- Supported platform names include WooCommerce (WordPress).
- If no platform is explicit, default the QA/support platform to WooCommerce.
- If a customer/ticket explicitly names WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Magento, or PrestaShop, use that platform in support steps, prerequisites, and business wording.
- Treat the underlying feature as shared Woo behavior unless the card limits the implementation scope, but document/test on the customer-reported platform.

## Inputs

Best input package:

- card name/id/url
- release name
- approved US + AC
- reviewed TCs
- AI QA summary/evidence
- support sign-off notes
- developed by / tested by
- toggles/prerequisites
- known limitations
- rollout notes

If some inputs are missing, still generate a useful draft, but mark unknown fields clearly. Do not invent ownership, release numbers, toggles, or unsupported limitations.

## Document Selection

Generate based on user request:

- "support guide", "support doc", "demo doc", "customer support explanation" -> combined release Support Guide only
- "business brief", "business doc", "stakeholder doc", "marketing/sales summary" -> combined release Business Brief only
- "handoff docs", "both docs", "support and business" -> both combined release PDFs
- "single card", "only this card", or a specific card id/name -> single-card document for that card

If unclear, ask which one: Support Guide, Business Brief, or both.

## Support Guide Purpose

The Support Guide is for support/demo teams who need to understand the feature well enough to explain it to customers.

It must be practical, professional, and support-friendly and very crisp and do not use any Technical jargon.

Use no technical words anywhere in the body of either document: no code, class, file, or method names, no API or schema jargon, and no internal engineering terms. Write it the way you would explain the feature to someone who has never seen the code. Three places are exempt, because the exact string is the point: the request/log callouts described above, the `Technical Cards` section, and toggle keys in the index table and `Toggles & Prerequisites` tables.

- Include the Index Page with exactly these columns: "Story ID", "Story Title", "Toggle Name", "Trello card link"
- Explain"Brief Feature Summary" in a title called "Brief Description" Keep it very crisp
- include where support can see it inside the relevant walkthrough steps
- explain what the merchant should experience
- include walkthrough steps
- include toggles/prerequisites

Do not write vague release notes. This should be a real support enablement document.


## PDF Generation

When the user asks for PDF:

1. Generate the markdown first.
2. Save the markdown under `data/handoff_docs/`.
3. Render PDF using:
   `skills/woo-handoff-docs/scripts/render_handoff_pdf.py`

For one requested release document, create one combined PDF containing all selected/approved release cards.

For both, create two combined PDFs: one Support Guide package and one Business Brief package.

## Slack Delivery

Send with `scripts/send_handoff_pdf_to_slack.py`. Nothing is sent without `--yes`, so always dry-run first and show the resolved target.

```bash
# dry run — prints target, filename, size, message text
python3 scripts/send_handoff_pdf_to_slack.py --pdf <pdf path> --title "<doc title>"

# DM to the doc owner (default target)
python3 scripts/send_handoff_pdf_to_slack.py --pdf <pdf path> --title "<doc title>" --yes

# team channel: bare --channel targets qa_members_internal
python3 scripts/send_handoff_pdf_to_slack.py --pdf <pdf path> --title "<doc title>" --channel --yes
```

**When the request already names a destination, that is the approval — do not ask again.**
"DM me the PDF", "send it to me", "share it in #qa-team" all authorise that one send: dry-run,
then send in the same turn, then report the target and file id. Re-sending a corrected version
of a document the user already asked to be sent needs no fresh approval either.

Ask first only when:

- the user asked for a document but named no destination, or
- the send target differs from the one they named — in particular, approval for a DM is never
  approval for a team channel, and vice versa.

Always report the outcome: target, file id on success, or the exact Slack error on failure.

## Prerequisite List Follow-Up

After a release package is generated, send the consolidated prerequisite list as a
Slack DM to `ashok@pluginhive.com`. This is a standing instruction from the doc
owner, so it needs no fresh approval — but always show the message text before
sending, then report the result.

Rules:

- Send the prerequisite list only. Never attach the document to this message;
  document delivery stays under `Slack Delivery` above.
- Skip the step entirely when no card in the release has a prerequisite. Say so in
  the final response instead of sending an empty message.
- Build the list with `woo-feature-prerequisites`, reusing the `Toggle Name` column
  of the guide's index table as the source, and check it against the live site.
- WooCommerce prerequisites are **not** `"<uuid>.<flag>": true` lines — that is the
  MCSL/Shopify shape and it does not apply here. Send them grouped by kind:

```
Site: <site url>            Plugin: PH Multi Carrier Shipping <version>

Plugin build
  - needs >= 4.2.0 for MCSL-412 (site is on 4.1.6)

Plugin settings to enable
  - residential address detection   (Shipping > Multi Carrier > General)
  - dry ice support                 (per-product, Shipping tab)

Manual — cannot be set over REST
  - UPS carrier registration
    <site>/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ph_multi_carrier_ups_registration
```

- When a release spans more than one QA site, send one block per site, each headed
  by its site URL.
- Use `woo-slack-operator` for the DM, since this is a text message rather than a
  file upload.
- Carry over the `woo-feature-prerequisites` guardrails: never invent a
  prerequisite, never report `unknown` as enabled, and list anything left out with
  a one-line reason.

## Combined Release Package Structure

Combined Support Guide:

```markdown
# <Release> Support Guide

## Included Story Cards
| Story ID | Story Title | Toggle Name | Trello card link |
|---|---|---|---|

## <Story ID> - <Card title>
### Brief Description
...

## Technical Cards
### <Story ID> - <Card title>
...
```

Do not add a `How Support Should Use This Package` section. The index page is followed directly by the first card section.

Combined Business Brief:

```markdown
# What's New: <Release>

## Release Overview
...

## Included Updates
| Story ID | Story Title | Toggle Name | Trello card link |
|---|---|---|---|

## <Story ID> - <Card title>
### Brief Description
...

## Technical Cards
### <Story ID> - <Card title>
...
```

## Technical Cards Section

Layout rules, which follow how `render_pdf_bytes` breaks pages:

- Use one H2 `## Technical Cards` after the last normal card section. Inside a combined package the renderer page-breaks before every non-package H2, so this section gets its own page automatically — never hand-place a break.
- List each technical card under it as an H3 `### <Story ID> - <Card title>` so the short entries flow together instead of taking a page each.
- Two to four lines per card: what changed, and why it matters for the product or the merchant. No walkthrough, no toggles section, no expected-behaviour section.
- Plain wording still applies. Name a version, endpoint, or field only when the entry makes no sense without it.
- Omit the section entirely when the release has no technical cards.

## Support Guide Structure

For each card section inside the combined Support Guide, follow the sample release support guide style:

```markdown
# Support Guide: <Story ID or concise feature name>

## Brief Description
...

## Toggles & Prerequisites
...

## Step-by-Step Support Walkthrough
...

## Expected Behaviour
...
```

Do not add `Merchant-Safe Explanation`, `Common Questions & Troubleshooting`, or `Support Escalation Packet` sections. The card section ends after `Expected Behaviour`.

## Quality Bar

Before finalizing:

- make it understandable for support people
- remove internal/code jargon entirely from the body; the only exceptions are request/log callouts and the `Technical Cards` section
- verify every card's toggle was searched for across comments, checklists, and QA evidence, not just the description
- verify no card labelled `SL: ON Hold`, `SL: Carrier Platform`, `Spill Over`, or `SL: Closed By Support` slipped into the index table or the body
- verify technical-only cards sit in the `Technical Cards` section at the end, not mixed into the walkthrough cards
- keep merchant-facing wording safe and clear
- do not expose implementation details that customers do not need
- verify every claim comes from card/AC/TC/AI QA evidence or researched domain facts
- verify every live Trello QA comment and checklist has been considered before finalizing a release package
- do not add a generic `Where to Find This in Woo` section; include exact platform-aware navigation in the relevant walkthrough step instead
- include highlighted exact request/log node names when the card requires request-payload, response, or diagnostic-log verification, such as `discount`, `declarationStatement`, `signature`, `classification_type`, or carrier-specific service fields
- every story card starts on a new page, including the first — the index page stands alone and the renderer inserts the breaks, so never hand-place one
- verify no card heading starts at the bottom of a page without its detail table/content following on the same page
- keep the support guide thorough enough for a support call
- keep the business brief short and polished

## Final Response

Return:

- document(s) generated
- markdown path if saved
- PDF path if rendered
- whether the toggle list DM was sent, skipped because no card has a toggle, or failed
- which cards were excluded and the label that triggered each exclusion
- any missing inputs or assumptions

Use absolute file paths in final responses.
