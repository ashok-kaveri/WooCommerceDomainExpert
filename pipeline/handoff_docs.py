_SUPPORT_PROMPT = """You are writing a support-ready story-card guide for PluginHive's WooCommerce shipping plugins on WordPress/WooCommerce.

This document is used internally by support, QA, account managers, and escalation owners. \
It should match the Woo 378 Support Guide style: practical, support-facing, card-specific, \
and written so a support engineer can explain, verify, and escalate the change without reading code.

Use this EXACT section order — no other sections:

1. `# Support Guide: <Story ID or concise feature name>`
2. `<Original card title>` as a short subtitle line below the title when available.
3. `## Brief Description` — 2-4 sentences, one paragraph, explaining what changed, why it matters, \
   and the affected carrier/product area. Keep it support-facing, not marketing-heavy. No preamble.
4. `## Toggles & Prerequisites` — markdown table with columns \
   `| Toggle / config note | What support should confirm |`. \
   At most 4 rows. Include detected toggles, release/store prerequisite, and the carrier/account or \
   platform prerequisite only when it actually matters for this card. Use "No toggle" when none is known.
5. `## Step-by-Step Support Walkthrough` — numbered support steps to verify or explain the feature. \
   At most 8 numbered steps in total across all scenarios. Use at most 2 scenarios, and only when the \
   second one covers genuinely different behaviour. One line per step — no sub-bullets restating the step. \
   Include the exact admin path inside the relevant step, such as WooCommerce > Orders, \
   Multi Carrier > <carrier> registration, WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping, Products > product > Shipping, \
   BigCommerce Orders/Products/checkout/rate automation, Magento Orders/Products, PrestaShop Orders/Products, \
   checkout, or request logs. \
   Use the customer/test platform from the card/ticket. Do not default to WordPress admin when WooCommerce, \
   BigCommerce, Magento, or PrestaShop is detected; if the implementation is shared, say support is validating it on the reported platform. \
   Do not add a separate generic `Where to Find This in Woo` section.
   If the card requires payload, carrier request, response, or diagnostic log verification, add a highlighted \
   bullet immediately after the relevant step. The bullet must start with a plain dash and one of these \
   label texts, with no backticks or extra dash around the label: \
   Request node to verify:  /  Request nodes to verify:  /  Request/response nodes to verify:  /  \
   Request/log fields to verify:  \
   For example, exactly: - Request nodes to verify: discount, declarationStatement
6. `## Expected Behaviour` — markdown table with columns \
   `| What support should observe | How to confirm |`. \
   At most 4 rows, each a distinct signal — UI result, request/log result, document/report result, \
   or sync result. Do not repeat the walkthrough steps here.
   Include exact request/log node names when the card or QA evidence requires payload verification.

The document ends after `Expected Behaviour`.

Length: the whole document must stay under 400 words. Support reads this during a call — every \
sentence must tell them something they would otherwise have to ask engineering. Cut anything else.

Accuracy rules:
- Name a specific field, value, or setting ONLY if the card evidence names it. Never round out a list \
  with plausible-sounding extras: if the card says dimensions are editable, write dimensions, not \
  "weight, dimensions, and other fields".
- When a card's human QA Notes conflict with generated test-case scenarios in the comments, trust the \
  QA Notes — the generated scenarios can contain invented specifics.
- When the editable/affected fields are not enumerable from the evidence, say "the fields the card \
  makes editable" rather than guessing which ones.

Formatting rules:
- Use markdown tables with pipe syntax — header row, separator row (|---|---|), then data rows.
- Never use giant paragraphs — prefer bullets, numbered lists, and tables.
- Mention WooCommerce navigation paths naturally: WooCommerce > Orders, WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping, Multi Carrier > <carrier>, Products > product > Shipping, etc.
- Call out carrier names explicitly when the feature is carrier-specific.
- No filler: no "this section describes", no restating the card title, no closing summary.
- DO NOT add: Merchant-Safe Explanation, Common Questions & Troubleshooting, Support Escalation Packet, \
  The Problem, The Solution, Key Benefits, User Story, Test Scenarios, Acceptance Criteria Checklist, \
  AI Code Analysis, Rollout Notes, or References.
- Use facts from the context only. If a detail is missing, phrase it as "Confirm from live store/card context" rather than inventing.

CONTEXT:
{context}
"""


_BUSINESS_PROMPT = """You are writing a customer-facing, marketing-style Business Brief for a new feature in PluginHive Woo \
(Multi-Carrier Shipping Labels) on WordPress/WooCommerce.

Your audience is merchants on the platform identified by the card/ticket, e-commerce store owners, account managers, and product marketing — \
NOT engineers or QA teams. Write as if this will appear on a product update page or be shared with a customer \
success manager explaining the release to a merchant.

Tone: Friendly, benefit-first, real-world focused. No jargon, no API field names, no enum values, no code identifiers.

Use this exact section order:
1. `# What's New: <feature name in plain English>`
2. `## Brief Description`
3. `## What You Can Do Now`
4. `## Real-World Scenarios`
5. `## Who Benefits`
6. `## How to Get Started`
7. `## What Stays the Same`

Section guidelines:
- **Brief Description**: Tell the story from a merchant's perspective. What frustration or blocker did they hit? \
  Use a realistic merchant scenario (e.g. "If your warehouse uses thermal label printers..."). 2-4 sentences max.
- **What You Can Do Now**: Plain-English bullets describing the new capability. No technical terms. \
  Translate any label format names (e.g. STOCK_4X6 → "4×6 inch thermal label") into human-readable equivalents.
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Write 2-3 short named scenarios (### Scenario 1: ...) showing a real merchant \
  benefiting from this feature. Use concrete details: store type, shipment type, what they do, what improves.
- **Who Benefits**: Short bullets — which merchant types, business sizes, or shipping patterns benefit most.
- **How to Get Started**: Simple numbered steps in plain English. Use app navigation in natural language \
  (e.g. "Go to Settings → Carriers → FedEx" not raw path codes). No more than 5 steps.
- **What Stays the Same**: Reassure merchants what hasn't changed. Calm any migration concerns.

Rules:
- Never mention API fields, JSON payloads, enum values, or code identifiers
- Never mention internal QA terms (acceptance criteria, test cases, fallback, regression)
- Use merchant-friendly language throughout: "you can now", "your labels", "your store"
- If the feature is carrier-specific, say the carrier name naturally ("FedEx" not "FedEx REST endpoint")
- If the card/ticket is WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Magento, or PrestaShop, do not call the audience WooCommerce merchants or give WordPress admin setup steps.
- If the implementation is shared but the customer card is platform-specific, describe the benefit for that reported platform and avoid unsupported cross-platform promises.
- Keep the whole document skimmable and upbeat

Use facts from the context only. Do not invent features or scenarios not supported by the context.

## Brief Description
This update covers the approved card scope for {carriers} behaviour in Woo. Support should verify it on the customer/test platform from the card: {platform_scope}. Use the card details, approved AC, test evidence, and live store state to explain or verify the visible merchant outcome.

## Toggles & Prerequisites

| Toggle / config note | What support should confirm |
|---|---|
{toggle_rows}
| Release | Confirm the merchant store/account is on {ctx.release_name or 'the target release'} before promising the behavior. |
| Platform | {platform_scope}. If the implementation is shared across Woo platforms, validate on the customer-reported platform unless the card asks for broader coverage. |
| Carrier/account | Confirm the exact carrier account, service, and order data before testing carrier-specific behavior. |

## Step-by-Step Support Walkthrough

1. Confirm the merchant store, platform, release, carrier account, and order/product/report context.
2. Open the relevant Woo area: {nav_steps[0]}.
3. Reproduce the workflow described in the approved card scope.
4. Check the visible UI result and any request/log, document, tracking, sync, or report evidence.

## Expected Behaviour

| What support should observe | How to confirm |
|---|---|
| The feature behaves as described in the approved card scope. | Compare the live UI result with the approved AC and AI QA evidence. |
| Existing related Woo workflows continue to work. | Run the adjacent order/product/carrier flow noted in the card context. |

## Brief Description
{platform_merchants} using {carriers} through the Woo app previously encountered a limitation in this area. \
This update removes that blocker so your store can ship more smoothly without workarounds.

## What You Can Do Now
- The new capability is now available directly inside the Woo app — no additional setup required
- {carriers} users benefit immediately upon updating to this release
- Existing configurations and workflows continue to work exactly as before

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Day-to-day shipping
A merchant shipping orders through {carriers} can now complete their label generation flow \
without hitting the previous limitation, saving time on every shipment.

### Scenario 2: High-volume store
For stores processing many orders per day, this update eliminates a manual workaround step, \
reducing the chance of errors and speeding up fulfilment.

## Who Benefits
- {platform_merchants} using {carriers} for shipping
- Stores that previously hit errors or limitations in this label flow
- Merchants looking for a smoother, more reliable shipping experience

## How to Get Started
1. Open the Woo app/settings from the platform used by this store
2. Navigate to the relevant settings area for your carrier
3. Configure the new option to match your shipping setup
4. Generate a label from WooCommerce > Orders to verify everything works
5. Contact PluginHive support if you need help getting set up

## What Stays the Same
- All your existing carrier settings and label configurations are untouched
- Other carriers and shipping flows work exactly as before
- No migration or re-configuration is needed for current setups
