# Woo Carrier Support Registry

## Purpose

This document gives the Woo Domain Expert a compact per-carrier support reference.

Use it for:
- carrier-specific card interpretation
- QA prerequisite planning
- request/label verification focus
- support-ticket diagnosis

## Generic Rule

- If a card names a carrier, treat it as carrier-specific.
- If a card does not name a carrier, treat it as generic Woo platform behavior first.
- Generic cards should prefer shared Woo flows:
  - `ORDERS`
  - `LABELS`
  - `PICKUP`
  - hamburger `Products`
  - hamburger `Carriers`
  - packaging / automation / request-log areas
