# Woo Carrier Capability Matrix

## Purpose

This document is the Woo carrier source-of-truth for AI planning, QA, and support handoff.

Use it to answer:

- Is the card carrier-specific or generic?
- Which carrier code and setup path are relevant?
- Is there local automation env support for that carrier?
- Which Woo areas are usually involved?

## Core rule

- If a card explicitly mentions a carrier, treat it as `carrier-specific`.
- If a card does not mention a carrier, treat it as `generic`.
- Generic cards should use a stable default carrier path for execution planning unless retrieved context says the feature is carrier-neutral or must be verified across multiple carriers.

## Platform scale

- Woo platform support from wiki:
  - 43 unique carriers
  - 46 carrier configurations
- Local automation-ready subset confirmed from `ups-woo-automation/carrier-envs`:
  - FedEx
  - UPS
  - DHL
  - USPS
  - USPS Stamps
  - Australia Post
  - TNT Australia
  - Blue Dart
  - Amazon Shipping
  - MyPost
  - Purolator
  - PostNord
  - TNT Express
  - Canada Post
  - Parcel Force
  - EasyPost USPS
  - Post NL
  - Aramex
  - NZ Post
  - Sendle
  - APC Postal Logistics
  - Landmark Global

## Shared Woo navigation model

Most carrier flows still reuse the same Woo platform navigation:

- top tabs:
  - `ORDERS`
  - `LABELS`
  - `PICKUP`
  - also `MANIFEST`, `TRACKING`
- hamburger navigation:
  - `Products`
  - `Carriers`
  - `General Settings`
  - shipping / packaging / automation areas
- WooCommerce verification:
  - `Orders` for fulfillment / tracking verification
  - `Products` for product creation and product sync verification

## Generic card guidance

Use `generic` handling when the card is about:

- order import or order grid behavior
- product settings
- packaging settings
- rate automation rules
- request-log / label-log visibility
- WooCommerce fulfillment sync
- tracking updates
- sign-off / handoff / QA workflow mechanics

These are usually platform behaviors first, and carrier details second.

## Carrier-specific card guidance

Use `carrier-specific` handling when the card mentions:

- carrier name
- carrier service names
- carrier credentials / onboarding
- special services like:
  - Hold at Location
  - COD
  - signature options
  - dry ice
  - alcohol
  - dangerous goods
  - duty/tax behavior
  - customs / invoice behavior

## QA planning guidance

- If carrier-specific:
  - use the named carrier first
  - use carrier request/response expectations from KB/wiki/code
  - use that carrier's automation env if available
- If generic:
  - use the shared Woo flow first
  - default to a stable automation-ready carrier path such as UPS unless context suggests otherwise
  - verify whether the result should be identical across multiple carriers

## Verification areas to remember

- Woo request / label / automation logs
- product settings and packaging prerequisites
- carrier setup / credentials / production key
- WooCommerce order fulfillment status
- tracking number sync back to WooCommerce
- rate automation / label automation rules
