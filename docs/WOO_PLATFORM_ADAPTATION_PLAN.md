# Woo Domain Expert Adaptation Plan

This file is now a current-state adaptation map, not an old gap tracker.

## Goal

Keep the FedEx-style workflow pattern where it improves throughput, while grounding reasoning and execution in Woo truth:
- Woo carriers
- Woo WooCommerce plugin settings screen
- Woo automation repo
- Woo logs and request expectations
- Woo toggle and store context

## Current Platform Status

The repo is past first-pass planning. Core workflow layers are already implemented.

Already implemented:
- split QA workflow tabs
- Trello-driven release loading
- AC generation and validation
- release intelligence
- TC generation, review, feedback regeneration, share, and publish
- TC-first AI QA execution
- failed-finding review and developer notification
- approval and sign-off flow
- automation writing, run, docs, and manual bug reporter flow
- Woo toggle and store-state capture
- carrier knowledge and request registry support

## Current Workflow Model

### 1. Validate AC
- load release cards from Trello
- run Woo validation, diagnosis, and release analysis automatically
- review card requirements
- handle Woo toggle prerequisites
- generate or review AI AC
- validate, fix, and revalidate AC

### 2. Generate TC
- generate test cases from the current AC draft
- review, regenerate, edit, and re-review
- share to Slack
- publish Trello summary and positive cases to Sheets

### 3. AI QA Verifier
- execute ranked reviewed test cases
- gather evidence from live app behavior
- use the current WooCommerce browser flow by default; when a card explicitly names WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Magento, or PrestaShop, ask QA whether to execute it through the available flow and proceed only after confirmation
- normalize navigation wording to supported Woo destinations before execution
- reuse local automation page-object patterns for iframe navigation, Order Id filtering, Actions menu, request logs, label generation, and document checks
- preserve carrier display name and internal carrier code for carrier-specific order setup
- support reruns and `qa_needed`
- review findings and bugs

### 4. Generate Automation Script
- detect existing-vs-new automation targets
- generate or update automation
- run automation
- post results
- generate docs
- raise manual QA bugs

## Woo-Specific Operating Rules

### Navigation
- AC/TC/docs can be platform-aware on WordPress/WooCommerce
- if a card does not explicitly name a platform, default QA/support wording to WooCommerce
- current AI QA browser and automation execution use the WooCommerce flow; explicit non-WooCommerce cards require QA confirmation before execution because the underlying feature is usually shared across platforms
- navigation should use Woo app paths and automation knowledge, not FedEx routes

### Verification
- many scenarios use API order creation
- some scenarios still require WooCommerce storefront or admin verification
- request and log verification should be based on Woo request expectations

### Toggle Handling
- live app or API state should be preferred when available
- `store_uuid`, `account_uuid`, and toggle state are part of the active workflow
- Slack escalation remains part of orchestration

### Analysis
- validation, diagnosis, and release intelligence must stay Woo-native
- FedEx is a workflow reference only

## Current Improvement Areas

The highest-value remaining work is:
- more live end-to-end validation against Trello, Slack, Sheets, and app data
- wording and layout cleanup where QA wants tighter FedEx familiarity
- deeper Woo troubleshooting knowledge ingestion if support-history reasoning needs to improve

## Documentation Rule

If workflow changes again, update this file together with:
- [README.md](README.md:1)
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md:1)
- [docs/FEDEX_FLOW_PARITY_NOTES.md](docs/FEDEX_FLOW_PARITY_NOTES.md:1)
